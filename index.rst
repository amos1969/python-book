CAS: An Introduction to Python Programming for Teachers
=======================================================

Introduction
::::::::::::

The aim of this Interactive Textbook is to cover enough Python to allow teachers to teach the programming concepts found
in GCSE Computing/Computer Science NEA tasks. The aim is to have a book for teachers and a book for students, which may
or may not have very similar tasks in them, or may just have slightly different emphasis on what the important concepts
are.
