What needs to be installed?
---------------------------

Python 3 for multiple platforms is available from the Python website: Python_.

Download the installer for your Operating System and follow the instructions. On Windows make sure you select the box
which asks if you want to add Python to the System Path. You definitely do want to do this, as it solves lots of later
problems which might otherwise trip you up.

Preferably you should just use the built in IDLE editor.

If this is too basic for you needs you can install other editors such as Pycharm, but that is beyond the scope of this
book.
