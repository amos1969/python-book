An Introduction to Programming
==============================

Why Programming?
----------------

The National Curriculum which was published in 2014, at Key Stage 3, talks about students (in Key stage 3) learning to
program in at least two languages, one of which should be text based. This then translates at Key Stage 4 as a text
based language which can then be used to complete the NEA (**Non-Examined Assessment**) task which is required by all of
the boards. At the time of writing this comprises 20% of the final grade at GCSE and has to be completed under close
supervision by the staff of the school.

Each of the boards publishes a new programming task or tasks in September, for that year's Year 11 students to complete
(the Year 11s who will be sitting the exam). this then has to be completed, submitted and marked by the teachers at the
school by sometime in March. The board will then use the time after submission to moderate the marks (ensuring that the
tasks are given consistent marks across all of the centres delivering the course) and investigating any possible
accusations of malpractice (for instance where the strict rules governing the delivery of this component, may have been
contravened).

The expectation is that during Year 10 (and before), teachers will teach various aspects of programming, program design
and testing, so that by the time the tasks are published the students will have a range of tools at their disposal to
enable them to design, program and test an efficient solution to the task assigned. The 20 or so hours they have to
complete this, also encompasses producing the write up that will enable them to gain the marks for the assignment.

The problem is that very few teachers have sufficient experience in programming to enable them to feel confident when it
comes to attempting similar tasks, let alone teaching children enough generic skills that they will be successfully
prepared to attempt the tasks that are assigned. The aim of this book is to help both students and teachers to become
more confident in the way they approach such tasks, using the Python programming language.

Why Python?
-----------

**Why not?**

Across all of the schools delivering Computer Science at Key Stage 4, anecdotally it appears that at least 80% of them
seem to be using Python. There are a number of reasons for this.

+ Every one else seems to be using Python, so i will too.
+ All of the online resources for teaching Python seem to focus on Python
+ Most of the CPD courses available seem to focus on Python.

With Python commanding such a large proportion of the user base, these are probably more symptoms of its' success than
causes, below are some of the things that I think have contributed to this success:

+ Batteries are included: this is a phrase that the Python community likes to use, meaning tat Python 'out of the box'
  comes with a large number of libraries and built in tools that allow programmers to achieve complex results without
  having to install 3rd party libraries.
+ It was designed to be a language that could be easily taught to others.
+ It is possible to create hugely complex programs without having to use advanced features of the language.
+ You can relatively easily create graphical games, programs that interact with the outside world, physically and also
  programs that can interact with the internet.
+ It is easy to read! Once you get into the practice of using white space to delimit you code (more on this later), the
  intention of the code becomes fairly easy to deduce.

Which Version?
--------------

At the time of writing, the up to date versions are 3.6 and 2.7. There are some differences between versions beginning
with a 2 and a 3, that make it difficult to use the same code for both. As a result if you are installing Python for
the first time, new (and experienced) users should choose to use version 3 of Python. The only reason to start using
Python 2 is if required libraries haven't been ported over to Python 3 yet, something which is becoming less and less
common.
