Getting Input from the User
===========================

Finding out What the user Wants?
--------------------------------

We've already discussed the generic shape all programs and computer systems take, so now that we've already dealt with
**output** from the program we're going to look at how computers get input directly from the user in the form of
text. This text could be used to choose an option on a menu, it could be data of some kind that the program will then
operate on, or it could be something else completely. To get basic input from the user we use Python's built in
**input** function, this was one of the parts of Python that changed significantly in the update from Python version 2
to Python version 3 and is one of the parts of Python which is used in different, incompatible ways between the two.
