Getting Outputs from your Program

Making Python Talk to the Outside World
---------------------------------------

All computer programs and systems boil down to a very simple model, basically there has to be some sort of input,
whether that's from a user controlled device such as a keyboard or mouse, an automated device such as a sensor, or even
an external device of some kind that sends a signal to our system.

This then is either processed itself, or causes some sort of processing to take place. Finally, once a result is arrived
at this then needs to be communicated back to the user or other computer systems by outputting some sort of value.

Basically we have **Input --> Process --> Output** there may be other things which occur too, in terms of storing things,
but every computer system and every computer program essentially boils down to a version of this model. So the first
thing we are going to do is make Python tell us a story, in other words we're going to get it to output some text and
other things.
